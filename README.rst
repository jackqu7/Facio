What is it?
-----------

If you work on quick turn around projects either at work or in your free time you might end up doing a lot of boiler plate cruft for your projects over and over, creating the same basic template. You might copy and paste this around, it might fall out of date, you might make improvements in a project but forget about them for the next.

``Facio`` gives you the ability to create a standard template (or templates) for your projects so you can bootstrap in one single command.

Originally developed with `Django`_ in mind you can use ``Facio`` for any type of project.

Supports
--------

* Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3
